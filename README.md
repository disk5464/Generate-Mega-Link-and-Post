# GenerateMegaLinkFromList
This script will get a folder, get the subfolders and see if they are on your mega drive. If the sub folder is it will generate a base 64 encoded link along with a post. It will use a file called New Text Document.txt located within the sub folder to put the description into the folder. 

This was mainly designed to help post a bunch of pluralsight courses at once. In order for this to work you need to have already uploaded the course to mega and have that new text document with the course description ready to go
