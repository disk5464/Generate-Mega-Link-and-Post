# GenerateMegaLinkFromList
This script will prompt the user for a folder path, look into it and get all the foldernames within, take thoes names see if they are on your mega drive, and if so generate a base 64 encoded link, then put them into a text file. It will also produce a text file for each link that you can copy paste into a new post. This was just a quick thing. There's no error checking and only looks at the root of your mega drive.
